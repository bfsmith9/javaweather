Created FileReadingObject - now all that file reading activity takes
place in a separate object. Maybe I can do something similar with
reading the present conditions.


Refresh conditions button is now working. I have the same question about
that code as I have about the forecast code - can I put all that in a
function, and perhaps put it in a different file? I also need to go
through these files more carefully and make sure I understand everything
well enough. I was wondering about final - did I need all that? Has the
program in general been done in an OOP way to the extent I learned in
classes? Next tasks: astronomical conditions, a button to bring up a
separate window for a larger radar image, and some kind of status window
that shows what the program is doing (while retrieving the forecast,
for ex.).

Adding RegExWeatherTesting program; still want to do some more testing
on this to see if I can remove usage of the array altogether with its
sometimes 4000+ lines.
