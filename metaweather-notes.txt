* This URL has NOAA current conditions in text format:
http://www.weather.gov/view/prodsByState.php?state=VT&prodtype=hourly
* Need to add a configuration feature. Can do it with dot files in users'
$HOME directories. Can find location, screensize, etc.
* How to get out of hard-coded URL's and values?
* Need to clean up RegExWeather.java. When there's more than one entry for
ST. ALBANS, it has problems. If it sees two ST. ALBANS lines, it will always
use the last one. I need it to stop at the first one. Looks like once in a
while NOAA gives out a huge amount of data accidently, which is why I had to
increase the array size from 5000 lines to 7000 lines. That's part of what
clued me in to the problem.
